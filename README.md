# SR Race Monitor

**Tests:**
![Build and release for android.](https://github.com/watho/sr-race-monitor/workflows/Build%20apk%20and%20appbundle/badge.svg)

Race monitor and little game utilizing the [SmartRace-App](https://smartrace.de) for slotcar racing.

This app receives events from the smartrace app for slotcar racing. See [smartrace.de](https://www.smartrace.de/en/)
and [buy them a coffee](https://www.smartrace.de/en/buy-me-a-coffee/).
The adapter uses the [data interface](https://www.smartrace.de/en/the-smartrace-manual/data-interface/) which is a paid
feature, so if you don't have a slotcar racetrack and don't use the
smartrace app or don't want to pay for the data interface then this app is not for you.
